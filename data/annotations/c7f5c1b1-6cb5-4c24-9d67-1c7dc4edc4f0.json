Big house.  Sister died before concentration camp.  Parents fled to another Czech town in 1938.  Parents were religious, kept a kosher home.  I married a non-Jew; father didn't speak to me for one year.  It took a long time for my parents to accept.  They were very happy when my first child was born, they made her Jewish.\n\nHad been sent by father to France to learn French- studied millinery, sister studied French.  Then to Vienna, business school in Germany.  Had small millinery business in father's house.  Gave up business when married.  Nice apartment.  When daughter born had a dog, bird, housekeeper, car- a nice life.  "

Never saw them again, because all placed in different foster homes.  He told me, gave me books- it was like the Jews- people killed, deported.  I liked him, was moved by his story, so we got married.\n\nParents sent me to Berlin before, to forget about him; parents wanted a rabbi relative to talk me out of it, but he didn't.\n\nMy grandmother died, and my mother claimed it was because she was upset about me, but I thinks it was old age.  But I postponed marriage because my father was sick.  I visited him every day in the hospital, even though he refused to speak to me.  Finally I did marry, and things got better after my daughter was born.  Later, after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, my husband was able to smuggle out money for my parents, and they were very grateful to him.  Parents left Sudetenland to stay with uncle in Czech proper one year after me. I left after the \"Grynspan Affair\" (Kristallnacht)."
