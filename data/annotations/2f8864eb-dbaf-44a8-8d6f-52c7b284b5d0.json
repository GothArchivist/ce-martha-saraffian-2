Since the early 19th century the Bohemian crown land had become the epicenter of a national and linguistic conflict between Austrian Czechs and Germans (in 1910 more than a third identified as Germans, over 60% as Czech). The first strived for a far-reaching autonomy or even independence from the monarchy. With the rise of antisemitism in the second half of the 19th century, Jews found themselves increasingly torn between the national and linguistic camps – at times excluded from both. As a result, from the 1920s onwards Czechoslovakian Jews increasingly began to identify as Jewish nationally, however, with significant regional differences. Most Germans – predominantly living in the peripheral border areas of Bohemia – vehemently opposed Czechoslovakian independence and identified strongly with (German-)Austria. In the 1920s calls for unification with Germany became increasingly loud. Many Sudeten-Germans began to organize in the pro-Nazi Sudeten German Party and its forerunners.

After the annexation of Austria, in March 1938, and the immediate anti-Jewish violence that erupted, especially in the Austrian capital Vienna, the threat of the annexation of the German-speaking border regions turned into a realistic fear, causing many Jews and Czech-speakers living in the periphery to move closer towards the Czech heartland and/or to prepare for emigration."

Although civil marriage had already been previously introduced in the monarchy, including in Bohemia, by Emperor Joseph II in the 18th century, it had been largely revoked in the early 19th century as recognized religions regained authority over marriages for their members. Only persons unaffiliated with any religion could then still get a civil marriage. This was called a “civil marriage out of distress,” denoting its exceptional character. Hence, in former Austrian territories such as Bohemia there were hardly any real interfaith marriages before the 1920s. In most of these cases, later deemed “mixed” by the Nazis, one of the spouses had been forced to either leave their religion (becoming unaffiliated) or convert to the other’s religion. In other cases, some people chose to convert or leave their religion pro forma for marriage and then re-joined. Martha Kummermann and her husband Hrand Saraffian, however, married in a Czechoslovakian civil ceremony and both maintained their respective religious affiliations.

It is very likely that Hrand Saraffian and his siblings were among these orphans and brought to Europe in a humanitarian effort, perhaps organized by other Armenians living in the diaspora. According to a post-war ITS document, Hrand Saraffian left Istanbul in 1897 at the age of six and “since then he has not acquired any other citizenship” (Arolsen Archives, 3.2.1./1718000).

In revenge for Heydrich’s death, the Germans carried out draconian punitive actions against the Czech and Jewish populations of the Protectorate. On 10 June 1942 German police and SS units massacred the male populations of the villages of Lidice and Ležáky, which had allegedly supported the attackers, and deported the women to concentration camps. The names of these villages became symbols of the German atrocities carried out in Czechia. In addition, the Germans also executed several thousands of Czech political prisoners and enacted martial law for two months.

Theresienstadt initially served primarily as a transit camp and was also the site of a Gestapo prison adjacent to the ghetto in the “small fortress” (thus Theresienstadt is sometimes also called a concentration camp). Commanded by a small German SS-detachment and primarily guarded by Czech policemen, the ghetto was internally organized through a Jewish “self-administration.” This pro-forma “self-administration” also served the Nazis’ propaganda of portraying Theresienstadt as part of a fictious “Jewish settlement area” rather than the ghetto and transit camp it was. At the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942, when high ranking Nazi officials discussed the “final solution,” Theresienstadt was designated as a ghetto for elderly Jews from Germany and Austria (Cf. “The Wannsee Conference,” in Longerich, "

At this time, he operated his own bookstore in Louny/Laun in northwestern Bohemia. After the Nazi occupation of Czechia their marriage was deemed “mixed” and Růžena Niklová declared Jewish. As the couple had no children, she was forced to wear the yellow badge and no longer permitted to work in their bookshop. In 1944 Růžena Niklová was deported to the Theresienstadt ghetto.

Did she consider the mica to be a talisman that had protected her from death? Did she want to keep it as a symbol of her strength and ability to survive even the most dire of circumstances? Did it simply appeal to her aesthetic sense? It would have been easy to have lost or discarded it over that time, not to mention that mica is a highly friable material that easily breaks apart. Mrs. Jonas must have deliberately taken care of the piece for it to have survived those sixteen years in transit. A display containing Mrs. Jonas’ story, her poetry, and the mica would thus form a very powerful exhibit that would make the viewer think about Mrs. Jonas as a person – the choices she made, the actions she took, and how she was able to survive the Holocaust.” (Ehrenreich and Klinger, “War in Context,” 153)."
