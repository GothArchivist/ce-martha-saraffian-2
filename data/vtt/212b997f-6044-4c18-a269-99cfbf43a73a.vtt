00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.320
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Some things
you can tell [AUDIO OUT] 30,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.490
31.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.060
And his children-- and
the children are bap--

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.060
INTERVIEWER 1: Baptized.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.280
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Baptized,
baptized, so they are,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.132
can be Christian.

00:01:01.132 --> 00:01:05.760
But my elder daughter
was in the Jewish Matrik.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.720
She got the-- the star,
too, and she was--

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.400
in the internation
camp for children.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.150
INTERVIEWER 2: OK.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.020
Now, wait a second.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.620
What's this?

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.835
That's for both children or one?

00:01:18.835 --> 00:01:19.710
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: No.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.640
For the Jewish child.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.916
Says she is Jewish.

00:01:24.916 --> 00:01:27.416
INTERVIEWER 2: You will show
them when you speak about them.

00:01:27.416 --> 00:01:29.801
Are we-- what else do
we want to mention?

00:01:29.801 --> 00:01:32.990
Are you ready?

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.100
OK.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.740
Now we'll begin.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.980
Bonnie will ask you
most of the questions.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.952
I'll be mostly silent.

00:01:39.952 --> 00:01:47.010
And begin with your name,
where you were born, what time.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.280
And see through your
own-- like if a film

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.280
would be rolling in
front of you, look at it

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.920
and tell us what you see.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.470
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.960
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yes.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.150
INTERVIEWER 2: Just--

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.177
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Do I
have to look in this?

00:01:58.177 --> 00:01:59.010
INTERVIEWER 2: Yeah.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.600
Yes.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.260
OK, why don't we begin.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.640
INTERVIEWER 1: Would you tell us
your name, when you were born?

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.900
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: My
name is Martha Saraffian.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.140
My maiden name is Kummermann.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:24.050
I was born in Prague
in September 15, 1907.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.830
And we moved to the Sudeten.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.040
At this time, it was Austria.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.700
It was not Sudeten.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:39.000
We moved there in 1909.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.250
And we lived there 30
years before the German--

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.370
before the German take over.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.560
Then we-- we--

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.850
were-- first, my
parents were leaving.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.490
And my husband was
not Jewish, and--

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.510
INTERVIEWER 1: Could
we just hold a minute

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.880
and tell us a little
bit about your family?

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.990
Who were the members of
your family, a little bit

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.803
about your early life.

00:03:11.803 --> 00:03:12.720
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yes.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:23.010
My-- my-- my parents have a
factory for linen and cotton

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.310
and we had big house.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.450
And my sister died before
the concentration camp.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.660
And my parents fled in 19--

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.780
beginning of 1938 to another
town in Czechoslovakia.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.240
INTERVIEWER 1: Um, can
you tell us a little bit,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.383
was this your only sister?

00:03:47.383 --> 00:03:48.300
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yes.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.160
It was my only sister.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.830
She died before--

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.440
INTERVIEWER 2: Can
you describe the home?

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.740
Was it religious?

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.775
What kind of customs?

00:03:56.775 --> 00:03:59.130
What was a day like, or a--

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.075
or a holiday, or a--

00:04:01.075 --> 00:04:01.950
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: No.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.700
My parents were religious
and we had a kosher home.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:16.769
And then even-- we were very
attached one to the other.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.380
We lived one from the other.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.460
And it was very
hard for me when I--

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.260
I married a man that was no Jew.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.170
My father didn't
talk to me one year.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.980
And when I married, my
mother took the suitcase

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:43.170
and went away, and I and my
father was in the office.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:51.010
Only my sister went with
me with the lawyer to the--

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.900
what you call it,
where we were married.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:03.000
And then it took a long time
before my parents got used to--

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.100
when my first child was born.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.890
So they say, we are very happy.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:15.458
But they wanted that she be
Jewish and said what we did.

00:05:15.458 --> 00:05:17.250
INTERVIEWER 1: Can you
tell us a little bit

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.700
about your early life, how
you spent your time, what

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.590
the weekends were like,
what your thoughts were

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.950
about the future for yourself
and your family, what

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.802
you thought you might
do when you grow up?

00:05:34.802 --> 00:05:35.760
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yeah.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.540
I-- I was-- my father sent--

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.010
sent us to France to learn--

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.620
to learn French.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.910
And I learned millinery, and
my daughter was studying--

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.940
my sister was
studying in French.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:02.400
And we went off to Prague and
even to Austria, to Vienna.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.610
We had really a nice youth.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.140
My father was well off and we--

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.030
he wanted that we learn--

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:20.130
I was also in Germany in
business school one year.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:28.140
And, uh, then-- a-and I
had the millinery diploma

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.970
I made in small business.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.970
In my father's house,
he gave me two rooms.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.090
And I had--

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:44.820
I made-- I had three girls
employed and I made these hats.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.100
Not-- not--

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:52.100
I didn't must to do
it, but I liked it.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.910
And then when I met my
husband and I married,

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:07.330
so I gave up the business and
we moved in a nice apartment.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.430
We had-- when my
daughter was born,

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:19.190
we had the dog
and bird and the--

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.880
we had the housekeeper.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.020


00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.610
It was really a nice life.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:33.130
We had a car and sometimes
we went by car to Vienna.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:38.922
And really, it was a nice life.

00:07:38.922 --> 00:07:44.460
INTERVIEWER 1: Did you
give up your millinery,

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.560
for what reason?

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.160
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Because
my husband didn't want--

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.510
he earned enough money.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:56.880
He didn't want that I work
because I had the child.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:03.030
And I help sometimes in my
father's office, typing,

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.487
when he needed.

00:08:05.487 --> 00:08:07.320
INTERVIEWER 2: How did
you meet your husband

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.600
and what was his business?

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.740
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: He was an
importer for Persian carpets.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.900
He was an Armenian.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:23.110
He came to Germany, with
a transport, children.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.580
What-- what were left
after a massacre.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:32.700
When the Turks massacred
the Armenians, he came to--

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.669
to Germany.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:42.159
With an-- it's like a self-help
organization what brought

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:45.150
this children to Germany.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:49.420
He came there with about
four sisters and brothers.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:55.270
He never saw them again
because they were all

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.180
placed in another foster home.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:08.020
So he-- he searched,
but he didn't get any--

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.470
he didn't see any of his family.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:16.860
Only one uncle was in Köln am
Rhein and he had the business

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.580
with stamps.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.610
That was the only
connection he got.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:28.450
And he was alone and
he told me this story.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:33.790
He brought me these books
from Fridtjof Nansen.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:39.520
He was helping these
Armenian immigrants and said,

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.850
I had an other book.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:44.000


00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.570
It was named--

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.630
Ein Volk in Not--

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:56.510
uh, "People in-- in--" what
you call it-- "in Need."

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.430
Say-- say, it was like--

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:00.450
like we, Jews.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.490
They were deported
and they were killed,

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:08.520
and what was left, went
and transport to Europe.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.470
And so he-- he was--

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:16.670
he was not a happy person
because he had nobody.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:23.150
And I-- I liked him and
I was moved by his story,

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.270
and so we got together.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:29.100
And uh, my parents
didn't want to allow it.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.300
They sent me to
Berlin to forget it.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.950
I had a cousin in Berlin.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:38.090
He studied rabbi and he
should to talk me out

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.170
of this marriage.

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:41.490
But he didn't.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:51.310
He said that must, must decide,
I only, and if I want to do it

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.380
or not.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.840
And my-- my parents
were very unhappy.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:01.550
And I didn't marry because
my grandmother died

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:07.400
and my mother said to me, she
died because she was so unhappy

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.710
that I want to marry this man.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.490
But she died, I
think, from old age.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:17.930
But I felt very guilty about.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:21.140
From this time, I--

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:25.490
I-- I waited a long time.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.990
My father was very sick.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:33.170
He was one year in a
hospital in Prague.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:39.660
And I went with him
always by-- by ambulance.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.780
I was sitting the
whole day, it seemed.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.050
He didn't talk to me.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:52.070
So then when he came
back home, so I married.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:57.420
He was better and he
went in the office again.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:04.460
And so later, I married,
and it worked out

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.240
when my daughter was born.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:13.460
And then when my husband
saved my parents money,

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:19.070
because he had money that
my parents should get from--

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:23.380
from clients, my
husband collected it

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:29.180
and went night over the
custom with the suitcase.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.110
And inside, he had the money.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.210
INTERVIEWER 1: Was this when
the Germans were already

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:35.960
in Czechoslovakia?

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.877
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yes.

00:12:36.877 --> 00:12:37.580
Yes.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.290
When it was occupied.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:46.720
Then my parents were very,
very thankful to my husband.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.540
So the whole thing
was straightened out.

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:54.200
INTERVIEWER 1: Your father could
no longer collect his own fees,

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:54.800
is that--

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.675
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: No.

00:12:55.675 --> 00:12:56.660
He left.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:01.340
He left before-- before I left.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:05.830
He left about, uh,
half year, one year

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:09.770
before l left, with my mother.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:15.590
They left all and went
to a brother from my--

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:17.390
my father.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:23.750
And then my father got sick
again so they went in the spa

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.970
and lived in a hotel.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:34.340
And when my husband brought him
only they rented the apartment.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:37.561
And we left after--

00:13:37.561 --> 00:13:44.840
after-- I left after
the Grynszpan affair,

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.630
if you heard
something from this.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:54.860
Uh, a Jew in Germany named
Grynszpan, he killed a German.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:14:02.150
And then it breaks out in
Czechoslovakia, this transport.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:08.140
And after-- after we left--

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:13.750
we left, uh, to the spa
where my parents were.

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.000
And--

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.800
INTERVIEWER 1: This-- excuse me.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.055
This spa that was in
Czechoslovakia proper?

00:14:21.055 --> 00:14:22.260
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yes.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.593
INTERVIEWER 1: In other words,
you left the Sudetenland?

00:14:24.593 --> 00:14:27.545
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: We left the
Sudeten and went in this spa.

00:14:27.545 --> 00:14:28.670
INTERVIEWER 1: Were there--

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:31.580
what-- what was the
story in the Sudetenland

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.330
when-- when you left.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:34.770
What was happening there?

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:37.950
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: When the
German came in the first day,

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:38.910
they--

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:43.260
they broke in their
houses from the Jews.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.360
They broke the door
from my parents' house.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.940
They took out everything
they find in--

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.830
in the shelves, in
the closets, in--

00:14:54.830 --> 00:15:00.190
in the drawers, in the offices.

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:04.980
Every single was on the
floor, it was high like this.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.810
From the wall, pictures.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:16.090
And from this handles
from brass, everything.

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:19.700
What they could
damage, they did.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.270
It was like the same
like the Russian

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:28.820
did after they are in
Czechoslovakia, and in German,

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:29.780
the same thing.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:38.070


00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:43.320
My husband went to the
officer Leut-Leutnant.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.350
INTERVIEWER 2: That's
1938 or '39 now?

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:47.930
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: '38.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.190
And asked them,
how it's possible

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:53.490
that you do something like this?

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:58.930
And he said, that's
the martial law.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:00.560
Kriegsrecht.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.800
INTERVIEWER 2: Martial law.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.820
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yes.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:07.110
And so we couldn't
do nothing about.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:09.380
And my husband
always said, nothing

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:13.340
can happen to us
because I'm not Jewish.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.010
But then when the
Grynszpan appair--

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:20.960
affair came, say-- say
we're like animals.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:28.770
They hit an old Jew, throwing
all over on the place, on the--

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:32.460
on the-- from the
town, the big place,

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:38.450
say, throw these Jews around
that everybody see it.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:42.350
INTERVIEWER 1: Can you
explain that to us?

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:44.420
How-- did you see this happen?

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.840
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: No, no.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.240
I didn't go in the street
anymore because they harassed

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.595
my maid, if she come
out with a Jewish child,

00:16:53.595 --> 00:16:55.970
they will hurt her.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:17:00.350
So my husband said, you don't
go out in the street anymore.

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:03.470
And then the Gestapo
came in our house

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:07.390
and took my husband
till he got--

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:11.550
till he got from
Vienna the confirmation

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:17.690
that he's not a Jew, because
he lived long time in Vienna.

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:23.868
And-- and then
after they got it,

00:17:23.868 --> 00:17:27.630
they let him out of the prison.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:32.180
And so then he realized
the danger and he--

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:35.460
he said, you must
go out from here.

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:38.970
So we had a car and the
driver took me over there,

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:42.850
over the custom
with my daughter.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.970
And my husband came.

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:51.890
My husband went to Berlin
and asked for permission

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:58.370
to move our belongings
to the Czechoslovakia.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:01.040
And he got the permission.

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.440
And then he packed everything.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.280
He sold his business
and then take him over.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.490
And we took an apartment
and we lived there.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:11.880
INTERVIEWER 2: What town?

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.370
MARTHA SARAFFIAN:
It was Podiebrad.

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:18.170
It was his spa, where
my parents were.

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:22.000
INTERVIEWER 2: So you really
left what was now Germany?

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.800
Or occupied Sudetenland,
which was Germany.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.500
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yes, it was.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:30.410
Then when they occupy,
the time after they--

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:35.720
they called it "Protektorat
Böhmen and Mähren"

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.570
INTERVIEWER 2: And you went
back into Czechoslovakia proper?

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:39.520
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yes.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:45.010
And there begun the-- the--

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:53.450
the transport with the Jews
because they made their head

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:57.860
from Czechoslovakia Heydrich.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.200
His name was Heydrich.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:07.290
And he let kill a whole town
from Czechs, men, women,

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:08.160
and children.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.590
The whole town was
killed and damaged

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:17.080
because he had such a hatred.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:21.530
They were against--
against the German,

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:26.660
or something happened that
he let kill all in this town.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:27.980
And one--

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.640
INTERVIEWER 2: Did the Czech--

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.420
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: One
Czech killed him in Prague

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.230
in a church.

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:38.020
No, some other place,
but he hided in a church,

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.300
but they find him and
they kill him, too.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.960
And from this time,
the-- the worst transport

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.960
was name Heydrich Transport.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.590
And this transport, my mother--

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:57.970
my father died before,
cancer, and he--

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:04.610
he could not be in a
hospital where everybody

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:06.550
was because he was a Jew.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:10.210
So they gave him in
the infection hospital.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:17.190
So when he died, then my
mother was caught in transport.

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.690
And--

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:20.670
INTERVIEWER 1: Can you tell
us a little about that,

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:22.560
about what happened
to your mother?

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.160
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: It
was the worst transport.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:31.260
They survived only
10 person from this.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:34.460
Thousands of people
that went to Majdanek.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:37.550
My mother was
shipped to Majdanek.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:41.260
And she-- she--

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.040
what I heard from--

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.430
from a survivor when he--

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:49.040
INTERVIEWER 1: Can you start
a little bit earlier and tell

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.920
us what exactly happened?

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.990
Where she was, when it
happened, where you were?

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:59.480


00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.180
MARTHA SARAFFIAN:
I was in a hospital

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:05.170
because I just got
my second child.

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:10.780
And my mother, five day
after my child was born,

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.450
my mother went in transport.

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:19.600
And she was first
going to Kolín,

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:25.360
that massive town from where
they shipped all the Jews

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.650
to camps.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:31.960
First to Theresienstadt,
and from there, via--

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.000
via Lublin to Majdanek.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.390
And my mother was
in this transport.

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.720
It was the worst.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:44.020
And I was told from a
survivor, that the Jews

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:46.690
had to run in circles.

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:51.880
And the SS men shoot--

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:56.950
the SA, the young
men, they were--

00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:00.980
what you call it-- an
organization, SA and SS,

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.670
SS were worse than SA.

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:10.270
But they ordered the
children, 10 to 15 years old,

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:12.850
to shoot the Jews.

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:15.880
They had to run in circles
and they shoot them.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:23.100
Some were wounded, so they
shoot them again till they died.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:29.320
But one men, he said to me,
I was alive and I resisted.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:33.640
When it was dark, I was
under the-- the deads.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:39.040
So I crawled out
and I saved my life.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.940
But there were very,
very little when

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.730
I heard from the Red Cross.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:49.540
Said to him there were
10 person only survivors.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:54.460
Later, I met in Prague this
man that told me what happened.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.260
INTERVIEWER 1: Did you
see your mother go?

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.470
Were you at home
when she went away?

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:01.540
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: No,
I was in the hospital.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.070
I didn't see her.

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:05.900
She come-- she came
to me the last day.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.650
I had the watch.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:09.770
I give her the watch.

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:11.470
It was not a golden watch.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.960
It was to hang on.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:19.990
And I give her this watch and
she gave me her gold watch.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:24.880
And I-- we--

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:31.500
we-- she gave all her
jewel to a Czech to--

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.550
to hide.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:38.470
And this-- this Czech gave
nothing back to-- to us.

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:45.610
And my-- my jewelery, our
pastor in this spa, he--

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:47.430
he put it in--

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:55.050
in three cases in the soil
in his-- in his garden, all

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:56.620
our jewelry.

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.200
And I got it back.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.230
I never claimed it
because I got it back.

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:05.650
But this pastor was--

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:11.140
he had so much Jews that he was
picked up from the Gestapo--

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:15.010
Gestapo, and got imprisoned.

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:17.890
But his wife was
from Switzerland

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:19.900
and she got him out.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:24.017
But he helped very
much the Jews.

00:24:24.017 --> 00:24:25.600
INTERVIEWER 1: When--
when your mother

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.840
came to see you at the
hospital the last day,

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.960
did she know that she was
going to be on a transport?

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.422
Did you know that she was
going to be going the next day?

00:24:34.422 --> 00:24:35.380
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yeah.

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:40.090
She said to me, we
go to transport.

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:44.500
Maybe tomorrow,
maybe the next day.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.840
I didn't see her anymore.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.030
INTERVIEWER 1: What did you
think when she told you?

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:51.970
What would you feel
when she told you

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:53.040
what was going to happen?

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.998
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: It was
a terrible experience.

00:24:54.998 --> 00:24:58.540
But I said to her,
when it's God's will

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.960
so we can do nothing about.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:06.800


00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.430
And we couldn't.

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:14.280
We couldn't fight
because we were--

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:19.920
we were-- the Czechs were the
same, anti-Semites, like--

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:23.000
like the German maybe worse.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.880
The Austrians were worse, too,
because we had in the camps

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.990
always Austrian
Scharführer and guides.

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:34.330
They were worse than the German.

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:39.020


00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.238
And I don't know
where I stopped.

00:25:42.238 --> 00:25:43.280
INTERVIEWER 1: You were--

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.950
you were in the hospital
having your second baby.

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:47.000
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yes.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.780
And I was undernourished.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:55.580
I-- I got skorbut because
I had not enough food.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:26:02.100
And I got it all over my body,
these blue signs from skorbut.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:02.630
And, uh--

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:03.547
INTERVIEWER 1: Scurvy?

00:26:03.547 --> 00:26:04.490
Is that scurvy?

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:06.374
INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hm.

00:26:06.374 --> 00:26:08.730
MARTHA SARAFFIAN:
What-- what, uh--

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:12.910
what, uh, s-seafarers
have when they

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:16.830
have only one kind of food, no?

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:20.530
So-- and I had no milk.

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:22.480
I had only water.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:28.480
So we had to send in
small farm for milk.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.990
We sent a man every day.

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:38.110
My husband bought a bicycle
and sent this man every day

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:44.400
for milk for my child
because we didn't get much.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.700
I got only this food cards.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:53.830
I got one egg in
the month and meat--

00:26:53.830 --> 00:27:02.970
no meat, no food, a little bit
flour and a little bit sugar.

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:06.490
And my husband got more and--

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:08.550
and my children, too.

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:15.880
The little one got one pound
of, uh, farina for a month.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.500
So we had to--

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.085
INTERVIEWER 2: What is
special about this card?

00:27:20.085 --> 00:27:21.460
MARTHA SARAFFIAN:
That-- that was

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:25.140
the card with the Jew on it.

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:31.790
It was given to Jews, but I
couldn't go and buy myself

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:39.120
because with this star, I was
not allowed to go in the store.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:47.520
We got these stars, my
Jewish daughter and I.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.130
And we had to carry all the--

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:54.210
through the end of the war.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:56.220
INTERVIEWER 2: So
half of your family

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.983
was Jews and half not Jews?

00:27:58.983 --> 00:27:59.900
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yes.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.233
INTERVIEWER 2: It was different.

00:28:01.233 --> 00:28:03.000
MARTHA SARAFFIAN:
It was always--

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.430
my husband said it was
always this sword of Damocles

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:13.020
because he always
feared that my--

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:17.880
my Jewish daughter
will be attacked, too.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.080
She-- she was with the star.

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:25.200
From the Czech children, they
bounce her on down the head

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.500
and told her always.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.805
You are Jew.

00:28:27.805 --> 00:28:30.280
You are a Jew.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:35.670
And so she couldn't go
any more in this school.

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:39.590
She was one year older
when we left the De--

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:40.110
Sudeten.

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:42.720
She was only one
year in the school

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:46.070
since she couldn't go anymore.

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:52.020
And we lived there till
my daughter was two year,

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.710
three months old.

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:57.380
Then my husband was ordered to--

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.160
to town.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.688
INTERVIEWER 2: What
year is it now?

00:29:00.688 --> 00:29:01.605
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: '39.

00:29:01.605 --> 00:29:05.060


00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:07.540
9, 10 of 19--

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:08.900
no.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.330
INTERVIEWER 2: Back up.

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:14.880
MARTHA SARAFFIAN:
This was already '41.

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.440
And my husband was
ordered to this town.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:23.640
And when the fire--

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:31.590
firefighters bombarded this
town because it was coal.

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:33.850
And they bombarded
everything that

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:40.196
was coal or electricity or--

00:29:40.196 --> 00:29:44.050
or what they could
destroy, they--

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:47.060
the German couldn't use it.

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:54.100
So my husband was ordered
to clean up this, uh,

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.990
pieces that were flying.

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:59.820
And in the meantime, I got in--

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:02.470
INTERVIEWER 1: How did
he get to this place

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:05.470
where he did this work?

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:08.860
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: He-- he
went by train several hours.

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:11.540
No-- no other communication.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:16.310
It's this time because
it was already occupied

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:17.890
from-- from the chairman.

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:19.770
There were only trains.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:22.810
The buses-- what-- what say--

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:27.130
say confiscated buses and
private cars, everything,

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:29.900
for them.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.860
So they were only the
way to go by train.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.360
INTERVIEWER 1: Did
he go by himself?

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.915
Did he go with--

00:30:35.915 --> 00:30:40.610
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: No, all these
men that has Jewish woman.

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:46.240
All these Christian
men had Jewish women.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.100
And then--

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:50.440
INTERVIEWER 2: Were
they special transport?

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.880
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yes.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:57.940
And my husband asked
for permission.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:03.040
When I sent a telegram, said,
I have to go in the camp,

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.710
in the labor camp,
with my daughter,

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:08.320
with my Jewish daughter.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:13.870
And he-- he was so upset
that he asked his com--

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:17.380
commander to let him go.

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:22.390
And these men gave him
a pass to go through

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:24.610
and he came at night.

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:27.100
And when I told
him what happened,

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:31.570
he-- he took the next train
at 2 o'clock in the morning

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:34.680
and went to Prague.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:41.550
The name was Sonnenbergstrasse,
where the Gestapo had the head

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:42.640
quarter.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.240
And he was protesting.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.240
He-- sent me with
just the child,

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:54.230
that they sent me with the
child to the labor camp

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:58.480
and when he was already
working for them.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:03.820
But he-- he was
not received well.

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:12.400
He got in, as punishment,
in a special transport

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:20.380
to Germany in a truck
without food, without light.

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:24.360
About three, four men
got in this punish--

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:25.870
got this punishment.

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:29.290
So they didn't want to--

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:35.740
they was-- they offered to
divorce me so he could be free,

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:37.150
but he didn't want.

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:40.570
So he was transported
to Germany.

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:44.050
The name was Klettendorf.

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:48.250
They worked-- he
got this on his arm.

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:56.710
It means, Arbeitet, "work
for Organisation Todt."

00:32:56.710 --> 00:33:03.590
And he was 11 hours in
bunkers working and carrying

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:09.800
these big pieces of
cement to the bunkers.

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:16.670
And he got really sick so
they gave him one egg a day.

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:21.896
And then when he recovered,
he got in another camp.

00:33:21.896 --> 00:33:31.880
And from this second camp,
it was nearly the end.

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:35.530
He came to-- back
to Czechoslovakia.

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:38.500


00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:44.960
A small camp where all these
men that marry Jewish woman

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.640
were in camp.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.430
INTERVIEWER 1: What was
the name of that camp?

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:54.370
MARTHA SARAFFIAN:
Bistritz, Bistritz--

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:58.390
It was near Beneschau.

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:04.260
And this picture was handmade
from one of this men.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:08.949
And he made postcards
from it for Christmas

00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:13.469
and sent it to my
husband after the war.

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:20.163
So that's what I kept it
long time in the frame.

00:34:20.163 --> 00:34:21.580
INTERVIEWER 1:
When you were still

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:25.150
in Podiebrad, what
was happening to you,

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:28.262
as far as your belongings
were concerned, as far as--

00:34:28.262 --> 00:34:29.179
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yes.

00:34:29.179 --> 00:34:33.610
We have-- I was
ordered to give up my--

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:35.750
my dog.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:36.920
We had the bird.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.290
We gave it before.

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:40.210
We gave it to friends.

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:43.770
But this dog I have to give up.

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:49.389
And my daughter was very
unhappy so we bought another dog

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:56.114
and kept our dog by a family
and gave up the other dog.

00:34:56.114 --> 00:34:58.240
INTERVIEWER 2: Why did you
have to give up the dog?

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.040
MARTHA SARAFFIAN:
Because Jews were not

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.640
allowed to have an animal.

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:10.410
So then I was ordered
to give up all my--

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:13.090


00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:21.310
my belongings, my fur coat,
my fur jacket, my fur head,

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:23.230
my fur--

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:28.534
all-- all what I have
from fur, from wool.

00:35:28.534 --> 00:35:35.020
From being in Europe,
we had fur Fußsäcke.

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:35.830
How you--

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:37.180
INTERVIEWER 1: Slippers?

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:37.630
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yeah.

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:37.710
INTERVIEWER 2: Stiefel.

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:39.950
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yeah,
to slip in the feet,

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:44.190
or here when we go in the--

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:46.970
in the-- Schlitten --

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:48.640
INTERVIEWER 1: Uh, skating?

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:49.590
INTERVIEWER 2: Sleigh.

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:50.740
INTERVIEWER 1: Sledding?

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:52.120
INTERVIEWER 2: On the sleigh?

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.550
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: It
were these horses, no.

00:35:54.550 --> 00:36:00.010
So we had these fur sacks.

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:05.140
And then we had to give
up all what was mine.

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:08.770
My husband signed
it as his belongings

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:11.950
because he bought it,
but I had to give up

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:15.190
everything what was--

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:18.070
what they wanted to have.

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:24.260
And that's what I kept from
the Jewish organization,

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:30.010
with a seal from Czechoslovakia,
that I gave it up

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:30.850
to the German.

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:34.294


00:36:34.294 --> 00:36:42.070
And then in the concentration
camp, in the labor camp--

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:44.110
INTERVIEWER 2: What
year were you--

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:48.540
MARTHA SARAFFIAN:
It was already '42.

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:52.020
And my daughter was in the--

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.400
in the children's camp.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.010
And once, she ran
away and came to me.

00:36:57.010 --> 00:37:00.500
INTERVIEWER 2: Do you remember
the names of the camp?

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.040
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: The
name where my child--

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:07.450
child was Jesle, Jesle.

00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:09.510
INTERVIEWER 1: And
the name of your camp?

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:10.797
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Hagibor.

00:37:10.797 --> 00:37:12.880
INTERVIEWER 1: What-- what
happened when you-- how

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.670
did you find out that you
had to go to the camp,

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:17.800
and how did that come about?

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.870
How did you get there?

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:22.030
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: By
train at 4 o'clock

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:24.700
in the morning
because Jews, they're

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:29.140
not allowed to go
during the day by train.

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:33.500
So I had to take the train
with my daughter to Prague.

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.380
And from-- from there, we--

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:43.540
we were picked up from the
train and escorted to the camp.

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:48.250
And my daughter run
away and came to me

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:52.840
and they, they let her talk
to me for a few minutes,

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:53.990
but we couldn't talk.

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:56.470
We both cried.

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:59.350
And she was taken
away from me again.

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:05.950
And then after time, we--

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:12.460
I was, um, warding sick
people in this labor camp.

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:16.450


00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:18.045
I cared for them.

00:38:18.045 --> 00:38:20.020
There were many people.

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:27.390
One had this scarlatina and
one has with lung something.

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:31.450
So they needed help.

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:33.340
It was in the labor camp.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:37.690
INTERVIEWER 1: This
was a certain building

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:41.680
in the labor camp where the
sick people were housed?

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:46.030
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yeah, but
this was not where I worked.

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:50.465
It was one where sick
people was there.

00:38:50.465 --> 00:38:54.400
There was one lady with
typhus and these sicknesses

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.810
in separate building.

00:38:56.810 --> 00:39:01.120
Where I worked
there, not so sick.

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:06.810
But it was also a
woman with scarlatina.

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:10.290
And I didn't know it
either so I didn't--

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:11.290
I didn't fear.

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:13.670
INTERVIEWER 2: You didn't
know how infectious it was.

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:15.040
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yeah.

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.990
I didn't know what he had.

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:19.820
I heard it after.

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.900
But-- so we--

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.890
we tried to help.

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:28.730
And the-- we were glad that we--

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:31.150
that our husbands
didn't divorce us

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:37.590
because there are cases
where the men divorced

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:40.480
when the woman was
already in the labor camp.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:44.560
So he divorce her, and
she was immediately

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:48.860
shipped to Auschwitz
and she was killed.

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:54.640
And there were oft so
much cries and unhappiness

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:59.650
because it happens many times
that the Czech men divorced

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:00.680
the women.

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.440
INTERVIEWER 2: The Jewish women?

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:03.898
MARTHA SARAFFIAN:
The Jewish women.

00:40:03.898 --> 00:40:07.825
INTERVIEWER 2: Your camp was
for women, Jewish women who

00:40:07.825 --> 00:40:09.380
were married to non-Jews.

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:10.630
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yes, yes.

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:13.220


00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.080
INTERVIEWER 1: Where
was your sm-- where

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.180
was your youngest daughter?

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:20.660
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: She was by
a family in the same building

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:22.070
where we lived.

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:26.930
They took her during the war.

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:32.210
And when we came back, so we--

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:34.650
she didn't recognize me.

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:39.290
It took time before she
again got attached to me.

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:41.750
But she recognized my husband.

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:45.710
He came back earlier,
but he was very sick.

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:47.180
He couldn't walk.

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:52.520
He was so sick, and
bones and skin only.

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:54.930
INTERVIEWER 1: How
did that come about,

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:57.890
that she was taken care
of by another family?

00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:59.540
And how old was she at the time?

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:02.270
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: She was
two years and three months.

00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:04.500
And we asked these
people if she--

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.800
if they would take care.

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.150
And they did.

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:12.560
We-- we left money for--

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:15.260
in advance for the--

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:21.930
for the child so she can
be taken good care of.

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:22.850
And they did it.

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:26.280
They had their own
child and she--

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:28.520
she was happy there.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:31.790
But then the night
before I left,

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:38.120
I heard her crying because it
was above me, this apartment.

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:42.000
I heard her crying many hours.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000
INTERVIEWER 1: What was
your feeling about that?

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.920
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: It was
terrible because she was hurt

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:52.510
and she was running and we
had such an Onyx Statue.

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:56.030


00:41:56.030 --> 00:42:00.170
And it was-- it has four
corners and she fell

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:04.610
and hit her head on the
corner and she was bleeding.

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:11.270
And so in this, I left
her when she was so--

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:15.880
with pain, and she was
crying the whole night.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:21.270
So they promised me to take
her to a doctor the next day.

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:28.640
Then I was-- from the
labor camp, I was--

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:35.370
we all were waked at 3
o'clock in the morning always.

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:38.450
What they did to us was
3 o'clock in the morning.

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:41.140


00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:47.870
they ordered to be at 4 o'clock,
ready to go and transport

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:49.490
to Theresienstadt.

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:52.490
We were guided to--

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:54.340
to the train.

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:56.120
It was--

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.580
INTERVIEWER 1:
What year was this?

00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:00.130
What year was this?

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:03.360
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: It was '40--

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:06.270
the end of '43.

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:09.490
We were guided to the train.

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:11.840
And there, we stand
till 10 o'clock

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:17.870
in the morning in the cold
wind and melting snow.

00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:22.790
Till 10 o'clock they left
us to go on the train.

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:24.540
INTERVIEWER 1: How
many of you were there?

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:29.560
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: There was
1,000 women in this transport.

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:34.580
We were told not to move,
not to go to the window.

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:40.340
The-- the Austrian Scharführer
were always with a gun

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:44.970
in their hand, going up
and down and up and down.

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:47.230
We were always guarded.

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:53.630
And we arrived in the early
evening in Theresienstadt.

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:57.690
This was a fortress from 19--

00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:00.510
from 1800.

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:04.390
It was built for military use.

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:12.790
Was a whole small town but
with two big fortresses.

00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:15.680
One was the worst.

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:19.250
That would be the
people that came there

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:23.480
so they are beaten to death.

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:28.270
I had-- I had two
friends from our town

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:30.920
that were beaten to
death there because they

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:34.272
didn't want to say where
they left the money.

00:44:34.272 --> 00:44:37.110


00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:41.060
And I was ordered to--

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:43.680
when we came into
Theresienstadt,

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:46.130
we came in a long hole.

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:50.880
It was like a catacomb, no
windows, only long tables.

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:56.370
And on the tables, we have
to wait for this card.

00:44:56.370 --> 00:45:01.370


00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:03.320
We had no more name.

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:05.960
We got a number.

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:11.380
This-- my number
was 732 and my--

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:19.970
the transport number was R.
And the car's name was AE1.

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:22.880


00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:27.530
That means labor
transport number 1.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:33.970
And I was assigned to work in--

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:39.670
in the barrack
for we have to cut

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:47.240
stones, mica stones, big
stones that came from Sweden.

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:54.150
We had to cut it eight hours to,
with a knife for small pieces.

00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:56.060
This is already broken.

00:45:56.060 --> 00:46:02.910
It was isolation-- isolation
for the airplanes V--

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:08.560
V1 for the German
fi-fire-f-fighters.

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:11.610
INTERVIEWER 1: Ins-- uh,
do you mean insulation?

00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:13.700
MARTHA SARAFFIAN:
Insulation, yeah,

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:17.450
for the fire-- fighter planes.

00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:23.470
And so we had to make
five kilos in eight hours.

00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:27.950
And who-- who didn't make
it didn't get their bread.

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:31.360
We had 350 gram.

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:36.830
That's about 3 and 1/2
deca for three days.

00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:42.970
And who didn't make this five
kilos didn't get the bread.

00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:45.110
INTERVIEWER 2: That's
about 12 ounces.

00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:46.920
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yeah,
I still not learn.

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:49.550
INTERVIEWER 2: 4 ounces a day.

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:50.960
Why did you keep--

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:56.030
how did you pick up
this piece of mica,

00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:59.810
and what did you think
while you picked it

00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:01.370
up and wanted to keep it?

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:04.170
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: I
had more because then--

00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:09.720
when we ha-- one
time, we had no--

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:12.620
not mica to cut.

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:17.990
So with these few pieces what
were left, I put it in my--

00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:20.090
in my-- in this book.

00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:20.930
INTERVIEWER 2: Why?

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:23.950
MARTHA SARAFFIAN:
Because it came--

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:25.290
the shipment from Sweden.

00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:26.040
INTERVIEWER 2: No.

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.550
Why did you put it--
why did you keep it?

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:30.470
Why did you put it in your card?

00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:32.360
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: I
wanted to show it.

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:39.300
If I-- if I leave, I wanted
to show it to my husband.

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:42.630
And so I kept it.

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:49.710
I had more things, but it
got lost in this long time.

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:56.450
I had already Ghettogeld to
the Gestapo, when we came in,

00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:58.150
they took from--

00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:02.790
we were ordered in a big
room, I had the nerv--

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:04.750
nervous shock.

00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:09.570
And the doctor kept me
till the last people--

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:11.730
we were 1,000 women.

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:14.500
And he kept me
with the last sick.

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:17.460
We went on stretchers inside.

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:19.670
So I was one of the last.

00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:25.590
They took from us our pocket
books, our jewelry, our watch,

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:27.780
everything we had, money.

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:32.190
But we had-- they took--

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:37.890
took-- grabbed it back from
us and hurled it in a corner.

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:40.090
It was like a big--

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:45.480
like a big hill from
so many pocket books.

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:52.800
And then we were sent to a
small room, about 25, 50 women.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:55.740
I don't know how many now.

00:48:55.740 --> 00:49:00.220
And we were ordered to
take off our clothes

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:06.000
and with flashlights, men
looked if we have lice.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:13.840
Then we were ordered
to a shower place.

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:15.420
We got a hot shower.

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:19.860
It was already night
and it was very cold.

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:21.290
They gave us a hot--

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:23.400
hot shower and a sheet.

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:30.270
And we had to go through an open
yard to another big building.

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:33.150
And then there are benches.

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:38.010
And then there we were sitting
till 3 o'clock in the morning

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:41.230
till they give our clothes back.

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:49.110
Then it was some little houses
there and we got in one room,

00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:51.010
about four women.

00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:55.440
And there were mattresses
on the floor, dirty, bloody,

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:58.870
and water was running
from the wall.

00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:05.540
But then the next day, we
came in a bigger place, where

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:09.690
the mattresses were one
on top of the other,

00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:12.020
and it was full of lice.

00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:13.110
We couldn't sleep.

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:14.510
It was so terrible.

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:17.880
It was falling at-- at us.

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.050
It was a terrible place.

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:22.380
INTERVIEWER 1: You said
the mattresses were bloody?

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:25.000
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yes from
people killed or sick,

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.386
I don't know.

00:50:26.386 --> 00:50:31.320
It was left for us because the
Jews were transported already

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.220
to Auschwitz to--

00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:37.050
to Majdanek to Birkenau
to-- or at Dachau--

00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:40.530
to all these places
where they had--

00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:43.230
I had many family in-- in--

00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:46.370
in the Theresienstadt.

00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:49.230
One family with the
children already

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:54.620
had tuberculosis when they
were shipped to Birkenau,

00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:56.510
and there, they died.

00:50:56.510 --> 00:51:00.240
And the others were shipped to--

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.970
I heard it from survivors--

00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:08.430
they were shipped to Dachau
and some to Auschwitz.

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:11.880
Nobody survived from my family.

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:15.120
I was the only one.

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:22.190
A few cousins left before
the war, one in Israel

00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:25.150
and, uh, and other one left.

00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:29.740
It was illegal on
a ship to Israel.

00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:35.760
It was kept in Mauritius,
in the island Mauritius,

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.740
from the English.

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:41.775
And that was all what my--

00:51:41.775 --> 00:51:43.780
was left for my family.

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:48.150
One cousin came back to
Prague, but he was so sick

00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:52.422
that he didn't survive
longer than two years.

00:51:52.422 --> 00:51:53.880
INTERVIEWER 1: What
happened-- when

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:56.520
you were sent to
Theresienstadt, what

00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:00.210
happened to your older daughter
who was in the children's camp?

00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:02.220
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: When I
came to Theresienstadt,

00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:12.160
we had to sign that we have
children and their religion.

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:16.620
And I was already in, so
I didn't fear for my head.

00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:19.020
I feared for my daughter.

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:23.280
So I signed that my
children are Christian.

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:26.580
And I was not
punished, and maybe

00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:32.660
didn't realize that I have
a Jewish child in the--

00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:35.200
in the internation camp.

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.710
But this Jewish
child, the pastor

00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:43.190
fought so much to get her
back and he got her back

00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:45.930
and we took her in his house.

00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:52.500
This pastor that was already
punished from the Gestapo,

00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:54.970
helping Jews.

00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:58.080
And he kept my daughter
till the end of the war.

00:52:58.080 --> 00:52:59.820
INTERVIEWER 2: Do you
remember his name?

00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:00.778
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yeah.

00:53:00.778 --> 00:53:01.650
He was the doctor--

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:05.610
professor doctor Josef Jeschke.

00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:07.770
And he died a
couple of years ago.

00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:09.440
I have his picture.

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:12.150
It was sent to me
from his children.

00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:17.430
I have the picture from his
wife when she died before him.

00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:22.320
And he kept always writing
me and I was writing him.

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:28.060
He was really an
outstanding man.

00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:32.580
And I'm-- I said many
times to him, he gives so--

00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:36.030
so good speeches in the church.

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:41.490
I sent my children in the
Sunday school with my husband.

00:53:41.490 --> 00:53:43.590
And he-- I--

00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:47.520
sometimes, when we
visit there in the spa,

00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:50.380
I went to hear his speeches.

00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:53.640
It was so outstanding
that I once

00:53:53.640 --> 00:54:02.010
told him if I would not be a
Jew, and the Jew that really--

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:10.080
can't change even
in-- in need, I

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:13.560
wouldn't be able to
change my religion.

00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:17.350
If I would be able, I would
change to your religion.

00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:21.530
It was-- he was Protestant.

00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:29.770
But he was really an outstanding
man and helping very much.

00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:36.150
Then when we-- after the war,
he was really, very, very good

00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:41.250
to us and my husband and
to my children and to me.

00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:45.390
Give us a big
help, moral mentor.

00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:53.040
And uh, in Theresienstadt, we--

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:59.370
we were-- I was
working on this mica.

00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:04.710
We had to go three days
during the day and three days

00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:08.440
at night in these
barracks to Bohusovice.

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:16.190
It was about a half hour
walk to-- to these barracks.

00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:22.440
Their maid said that people
cannot see the exploitation

00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:24.230
of Jews.

00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:27.210
We worked there.

00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:34.740
This was not a good work, a good
job, because the lights over us

00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:40.510
and the sunlight and this--

00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:44.163
this stone is shining.

00:55:44.163 --> 00:55:47.400
And when you cut it, it's like--

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:51.490
like, uh, little silver stones.

00:55:51.490 --> 00:55:54.270
We were all full of this.

00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:56.140
We breathe it in.

00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:59.690
And this was the
danger for the lungs.

00:55:59.690 --> 00:56:02.310
That's why we got this job.

00:56:02.310 --> 00:56:06.810
If it would be a good job, they
wouldn't have given it to us.

00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:10.480
And it was a very sharp knife.

00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:15.540
It was very-- we
often cut our fingers.

00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:19.060
INTERVIEWER 1: You-- you had
to walk from Theresienstadt

00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:19.843
to Bohusovice.

00:56:19.843 --> 00:56:20.760
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yes.

00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:23.632
INTERVIEWER 1: What were
your thoughts as you were--

00:56:23.632 --> 00:56:26.880
MARTHA SARAFFIAN:
We went always--

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:32.950
we passed the-- the
house where there--

00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:39.480
this barrack where the deaths,
where what died there, or not

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:42.150
say, killed there.

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.990
They killed there.

00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:46.490


00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:49.540
They were in this mor--

00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:51.375
mor-- mor--

00:56:51.375 --> 00:56:53.240
INTERVIEWER 1: Mhm, morgue.

00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:57.410
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: And they took
them like this on the truck.

00:56:57.410 --> 00:57:01.910
And I pass every
day and I was always

00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:06.230
crying because I was thinking
maybe my mother is in between.

00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:10.040
I didn't know that she
was shipped to Majdanek.

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:13.790
So a lady said to me,
if you cry every day,

00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:16.610
you wouldn't see your
children anymore.

00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:19.460
So soon, I stopped crying.

00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:21.856
And I worked.

00:57:21.856 --> 00:57:25.580
And I-- I had my shoes so--

00:57:25.580 --> 00:57:31.970
so soaked from this wet
snow that I give my bread

00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:34.820
to a Hollandaise
woman for shoes.

00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:38.820
She had a pair of shoes
that she didn't need,

00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:41.990
so she gave it to me for bread.

00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:47.410
And this bread, I have to
steal from the labor camp.

00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:51.410
And they didn't take it
from me, was like this.

00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:53.790
And she was so glad
she got this bread,

00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:58.622
so I was glad I had dry shoes.

00:57:58.622 --> 00:58:00.830
INTERVIEWER 2: In that labor
camp, what kind of labor

00:58:00.830 --> 00:58:02.460
was it?

00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:05.110
Before Theresienstadt?

00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:09.140
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: We-- we went,
always after the transport,

00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:10.696
to packing.

00:58:10.696 --> 00:58:14.660
That's what we did before the
labor camp and from the camp,

00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:22.130
too, to pack these belongings
from the transports in baskets.

00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:26.550
The German took
everything to Germany.

00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:28.880
INTERVIEWER 1: Uh, whose
belongings were these?

00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:31.070
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: From the Jews.

00:58:31.070 --> 00:58:34.970
But they-- everybody took
something with him, no.

00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:36.718
So they kept everything.

00:58:36.718 --> 00:58:37.760
INTERVIEWER 2: So these--

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:38.930
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: They got--

00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:43.237
they got these,
um, these dresses.

00:58:43.237 --> 00:58:44.520
INTERVIEWER 1: Mhm.

00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:48.330
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: With,
uh, Sträflingskleidung.

00:58:48.330 --> 00:58:49.830
INTERVIEWER 1: Mhm.

00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:51.988
The stripes, the prison uniform.

00:58:51.988 --> 00:58:53.030
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Not me.

00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:57.490
Me treated as mixed marriages.

00:58:57.490 --> 00:58:58.750
We didn't get this.

00:58:58.750 --> 00:59:02.030
We could use our clothes.

00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:05.210
But not the Jews.

00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:09.470
INTERVIEWER 2: The-- the
clothing, or the belongings,

00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:16.240
came back from Auschwitz
from Majdanek to your camp.

00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:19.605
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: The-- the--

00:59:19.605 --> 00:59:23.150
the people that survived
came back to Theresienstadt.

00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:24.858
INTERVIEWER 2: No,
I'm asking you about--

00:59:24.858 --> 00:59:25.900
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: No, no.

00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:26.780
Not these clothes.

00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:30.830
The clothing from the
Czechoslovak Jews.

00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:33.750
Only from the Czechoslovak Jews.

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:39.690
There were many, you know, other
than Jews from Czechoslovakia,

00:59:39.690 --> 00:59:45.440
but not went out before went
into the concentration camp.

00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:49.260
Because many from these
small towns didn't know what

00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:50.380
happened.

00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:53.060
They were picked
up and they didn't

00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:55.730
know what happened to them.

00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:56.570
I didn't know.

00:59:56.570 --> 00:59:59.890
My husband always said
that I'm indolent I

00:59:59.890 --> 01:00:01.640
don't read newspapers.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.000
I don't hear the radio.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.090
So I didn't know what happened.

01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:10.545
It was the spa and I had my--

01:00:10.545 --> 01:00:11.880
my child.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.180
I had enough to do.

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:20.312
They didn't allow me a maid and
we took an apartment when we--

01:00:20.312 --> 01:00:21.770
INTERVIEWER 2: The
clothes that you

01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:26.000
worked with were from
the homes of the Jews

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.180
or from the luggage of--

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:29.680
what?

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:30.190
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: Yeah.

01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:30.530
From--

01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:31.572
INTERVIEWER 2: From what?

01:00:31.572 --> 01:00:33.788
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: From the
luggage that the Jews had.

01:00:33.788 --> 01:00:34.580
INTERVIEWER 2: Yes.

01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:37.880
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: From
the coats and everybody

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:44.430
had, uh, sheets and then the
towers, and all these things.

01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:46.800
All these things,
they took away,

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:50.490
their personal
things and everything

01:00:50.490 --> 01:00:52.810
that they took with them.

01:00:52.810 --> 01:00:58.250
Many didn't know that
they go in a transport.

01:00:58.250 --> 01:01:02.460
They were assembled in
this town, in Kolín,

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:05.840
and then they were told
where they are going.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:08.830
And everything was
taken away from them.

01:01:08.830 --> 01:01:10.755
INTERVIEWER 2: And
shipped to your camp?

01:01:10.755 --> 01:01:11.630
MARTHA SARAFFIAN: No.

01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:13.940
We had to go by train.

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:16.490
It was not far.

01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:19.655
This town was Nymburk.

01:01:19.655 --> 01:01:22.580


01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:24.720
There were two towns, Kolín.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:29.180
They were assembled in Kolín
and then shipped to Nymburk.

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:33.120
And from there, they were going
to the concentration camp.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:38.240
And we went from Prague about
an hour by train to Nymburk

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:45.252
to pack these things from
these Jews from Czechoslovakia.

01:01:45.252 --> 01:01:46.460
INTERVIEWER 2: What did you--

01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:48.422
MARTHA SARAFFIAN:
After every transport.

01:01:48.422 --> 01:01:50.505
INTERVIEWER 2: Arriving
to the place of transport,

01:01:50.505 --> 01:01:54.130
what did you see and
what did you think?

01:01:54.130 --> 01:01:55.960
What did you see there?

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.550
It was crowded--

01:01:57.550 --> 01:01:59.700
MARTHA SARAFFIAN:
I was very upset

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:04.040
because I knew my mother
went the same way.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:08.440
And all my family, my
mother's sister that I--

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:11.800
I loved very much,
and her children,

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:15.630
and to my father's family.

01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:19.540
There were five
brothers left, all

01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:22.000
died in concentration camps.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:28.080
And my oldest cousins,
one of us and--

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:32.708
