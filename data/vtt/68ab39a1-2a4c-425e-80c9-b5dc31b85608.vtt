00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.444
[TONE]

00:00:03.444 --> 00:00:31.520


00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.800
MARTHA: But we really
got used to it.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.186
We had no choice.

00:00:35.186 --> 00:00:36.900
INTERVIEWER 1: And
they were what--

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.110
were-- they were sent in
what way, packages or what?

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.610
MARTHA: No.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.960
They were flying over there, and
we had to pack it in basket--

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.870
big baskets.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.440
INTERVIEWER 1: Yes.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.080
MARTHA: And these
baskets were shipped to--

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.500
to Germany.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.080
The last one was shipped
to Theresienstadt.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.450
And when-- when the Red
Cross came to Theresienstadt,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:10.100
we were ordered to put
down the windows, curtains.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.600
We had to clean up everything.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.840
And, uh, they gave us,
from this last transport,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.230
these things what they had--

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.710
sheets and so to
cover the mattresses.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.805
And we had to make it--
everything-- as nice

00:01:29.805 --> 00:01:31.680
as it was possible.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.330
We had to go on our
knees to clean the floor.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.700
And when the Red
Cross was leaving,

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.620
so we had to write cards.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.380
They wake us up at 3:00
in the morning always

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.040
to write home that we
got from the Red Cross

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.240
sardines and sugar and jam.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.470
And once, they-- they waked us
up to write the cards that we

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.320
were--

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.320
were then-- we
were by a concert.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.935
It's always 3:00 in the
mornings, they waked us up.

00:02:07.935 --> 00:02:10.925
INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember
the Red Cross people coming?

00:02:10.925 --> 00:02:13.560
Were you close,
physically, to one of them?

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.030
Could you speak to them?

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.887
MARTHA: No.

00:02:15.887 --> 00:02:16.387
No.

00:02:16.387 --> 00:02:17.180
INTERVIEWER 1: What did you see?

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.840
How did they--

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.860
MARTHA: On the end-- on the
end only, when the Swedish Red

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.390
Cross was coming to
pick up the Danish Jews.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.310
The king of Denmark
ordered the--

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.020
because Sweden was neutral,
so all these officers

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.030
with big buses came
for the Danish Jews.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.400
And the Danish Jews were
protected from the king.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.250
They got packages and, from
the Red Cross, always food.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.620
And I saw it the last, when the
German there on the end, they--

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.940
they're-- they're Sweden.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.930
So that was the only
things that I saw,

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.511
the Sweden Red Cross, never
from Switzerland-- never.

00:03:11.511 --> 00:03:17.760
And we were not
allowed to go, even

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.810
when there was a bombardment
from the American and we there.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.780
We ran out from the barrack.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.810
The Scharführer was yelling, you
are happy that our friends are

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.760
coming.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.540
And he-- he--

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.360
he ordered us in.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.430
We couldn't stay outside.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.810
We saw the fire because
it was not too far from us

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.030
where the bombs were falling.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.850
INTERVIEWER 2: Could-- could
you hear from your family?

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.370
Did you know what was
happening to your children

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.300
and your husband?

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.630
MARTHA: Yes, I got, uh,
sent, once they allowed

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.030
the-- the people--

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:07.540
the mixed people, who get once
a month a card from the family.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.120
Well, I could write
once a month a card

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.500
but it had to be 30 words.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.954
If it was one word more,
they break the card

00:04:16.954 --> 00:04:19.200
and throw it away.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.466
INTERVIEWER 1: Can
you read the card?

00:04:21.466 --> 00:04:24.580
MARTHA: It is [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.190
INTERVIEWER 1: Read it.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.110
MARTHA: "My dear
Noemi. it's in German.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.932
We were ordered, all,
to write in German.

00:04:32.932 --> 00:04:36.230
"Why do-- why do
not write to me?

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.860
Please write me if you
are in good health.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.250
I am so worrying for all of you.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.560
Is-- is, uh, Father
writing to you?

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.070
And do you hear from--

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.860
from your sister?

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.090
Did you send a package?

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.040
Did you get a package?

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.736
Please don't forget me."

00:05:04.736 --> 00:05:12.512


00:05:12.512 --> 00:05:17.810
This was a card from my
daughter she sent to my husband.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.980
It was on the end.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.750
It was already censored.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.000


00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.410
She say-- she wrote, "Dear
Papa, many thanks for your card.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.890
I was by the dentist.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:44.180
We both, my sister and I,
we both are in good health.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:50.280
I sent you a package,
what you asked me for.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.419
Kisses, Noemi.

00:05:52.419 --> 00:06:02.410


00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.260
Then I-- then, she
wrote him a card.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:12.710


00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.170
This is a card where
it's always censored.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.261


00:06:19.261 --> 00:06:30.960
This-- she sent him a card
where she wrote what--

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.190
what we all sent him.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.930
But the package came back.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:43.050
And it was no more
allowed to send packages.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:48.010
So he didn't get
what he asked for.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.730
It was in the third
camp where he was.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:51.730
INTERVIEWER 2: Can you--

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.105
INTERVIEWER 1:
Can you show the--

00:06:53.105 --> 00:06:53.740
the card?

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.500
The stamp is Hitler's
picture, isn't it?

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.670
MARTHA: Yes.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.580
INTERVIEWER 1: Can you
show it to the camera?

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.910
Right.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.490
This is a correspondence from
your girl to you or from you

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:06.542
to your daughter?

00:07:06.542 --> 00:07:07.750
MARTHA: This from my husband.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.340


00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:16.020
It comes from, it
was a Sonderlager.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:21.270
A special la-- camp
for this Jewish man--

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.075
this Christian man.

00:07:23.075 --> 00:07:24.700
INTERVIEWER 2: Can
you tell us a little

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.210
about the conditions at
Theresienstadt where you lived?

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.520
And were you segregated?

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.366
Were certain kinds of
people kept together,

00:07:34.366 --> 00:07:38.456
separated in Theresienstadt?

00:07:38.456 --> 00:07:42.450
MARTHA: We were
always in barracks.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:46.880
I cannot remember how
many barracks there were.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:56.090
But we had to go to
work and then the--

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.937
when we didn't have the
Glimmer work, this, uh--

00:07:59.937 --> 00:08:00.770
INTERVIEWER 2: Mica.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:01.810
MARTHA: Mica.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:08.460
We-- we were-- we got
a bucket and a broom,

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:12.680
and we marched, a thousand
woman in Theresienstadt,

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.450
to clean the town.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:18.480
The hospital there, the old,
sick people, were lying,

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.690
and everything had to be washed.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:27.710
And on our knees, we
had to wash it and to--

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:32.808
to roam the streets and
like this, when we had no--

00:08:32.808 --> 00:08:36.991
no stones to cut this mica.

00:08:36.991 --> 00:08:40.960
[INAUDIBLE] handkerchief.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.600
Thank you.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.299
I have here.

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:49.159


00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:53.490
INTERVIEWER 2: Uh, how, uh, um,
did you have your own mattress?

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:54.670
Did you have your--

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:56.400
MARTHA: No, no.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.840
We had no mattresses there.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.232
And we had to--

00:09:01.232 --> 00:09:02.660
INTERVIEWER 1: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.950


00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.690
MARTHA: We had to clean,
every day, our place before we

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:11.410
went to work.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:18.760
We had to wash the small
place where we go to the bath.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.450
INTERVIEWER 2: I mean,
did you have, uh,

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.565
your own bunk to
yourself, or did you

00:09:22.565 --> 00:09:26.050
have to share bunks
with other people?

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:29.908
A bunk bed-- did you
have your own bunk bed?

00:09:29.908 --> 00:09:30.980
MARTHA: Bed?

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:31.180
INTERVIEWER 2: Yes.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:31.690
One to--

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:32.140
MARTHA: Yes, yes, yes.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:32.860
INTERVIEWER 2: One to a--

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:33.580
one.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.870
One person to a bunk.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.470
MARTHA: Yes.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:41.207
We were-- we were four
in a little space.

00:09:41.207 --> 00:09:42.790
INTERVIEWER 2: Four
in a little space.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.787
MARTHA: Four in a
little space, yes.

00:09:44.787 --> 00:09:47.120
INTERVIEWER 2: What happened
to some of the women there?

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.410
What-- what, uh--

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:55.010
MARTHA: One after about me,
she got, um, at the end,

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:56.090
she got typhus.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.620
Because when the
transport came back--

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:06.480


00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:14.080
when the transport came back,
so she ran to-- to the gate

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.950
where these people from
Auschwitz were interned.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.080
And she saw her sister.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.350
And she kissed her
through the gate.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:30.620
And she infected
herself with typhus.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.270
We were all-- we--

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.110
we all had, uh, injection--

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:37.230
typhus injection.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:40.650
Because they were
afraid that we--

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.770
that we have an epidemy
in Theresienstadt,

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.393
and we couldn't work
on these stones.

00:10:47.393 --> 00:10:48.810
INTERVIEWER 1:
Vaccines, you mean?

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.040
MARTHA: Yes.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.010
And, uh, it was a
bad experience, too.

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:57.090
We were-- we all got
diarrhea from it.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.110
And once we were--

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:03.810
the only when we got meat,
it was from a sick horse.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:09.360
And we got this meat,
as, cooked this goulash,

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.830
and we were all sick.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.820
We were, the whole night,
sitting on the latrine,

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.053
one next, to the other,
woman, man, everything.

00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:19.220
INTERVIEWER 2: All together.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.095
MARTHA: All together.

00:11:20.095 --> 00:11:23.950
It was-- it was not
enough latrines.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:27.270
One took the other
away to get this--

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.310
INTERVIEWER 2: Pushed
the other person away?

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:29.810
MARTHA: Yes.

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:34.710
It was a terrible night
from this poisoned meat.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:39.870
And, uh, this, uh-- this
Austrian Scharführer what gave

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:43.110
us this-- what allowed
to give us this meat,

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:48.992
he was punished and
taken away from the camp.

00:11:48.992 --> 00:11:50.700
INTERVIEWER 2: Were
there some other ways

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.830
that you were kept busy in camp
when there was no mica to cut?

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:56.380
MARTHA: Only to clean--

00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:03.580
to clean, to wash, or to clean
the hospital, the floors,

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.260
and whatever was to-- to do.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.420
INTERVIEWER 2: You were
also given buckets of water

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.880
for some other
purpose, I believe?

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.240
MARTHA: Uh, yes.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:18.510
When we-- when we want to wash
us, we had to go for water.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.660


00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:25.220
INTERVIEWER 2: Uh, what--
was there something about--

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.250
MARTHA: We had the shower.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:31.210
We were allowed,
sometimes, to shower.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.510
We had to pay two
korunas for it.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:37.060
We got Ghettogeld-- money--

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.510
ghetto money.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:46.660
And I-- I gave this ghetto
money to my daughter last year.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.810
INTERVIEWER 2: Was there
something about fires?

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:50.560
MARTHA: Yes.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:55.770
We had-- we had a fire
in Theresienstadt.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:13:01.840
And-- and-- a woman said
to the Scharführer--

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:09.780
no, he put-- he put us in the--
in the barracks, burning paper.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.210
And he said, you need some job.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.018
So now, you can, uh--

00:13:16.018 --> 00:13:23.380
you can, uh, be the firefighter.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.770
And a woman said to
him, we should local--

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:30.940
localize the fire
from this side.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:37.610
And he took her bucket with
water and put it over her head.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:38.110
So--

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.930


00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.490
INTERVIEWER 1: He
made you set the fire?

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:43.990
MARTHA: Yes.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.050
He--

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:45.550
INTERVIEWER 1: Told
to set the fire.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:49.150
MARTHA: He set the
fire to make us work.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:55.180
And, uh, she allowed herself
to tell him something.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.550
It was a German Gestapo.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:04.390
His name was, I think,
Hahn, if I remember well.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:09.320
And so she was punished in the
wintertime with the cold water

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.400
on her head.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.300
INTERVIEWER 1: Did
people go crazy there?

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:12.800
MARTHA: Yes.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.130
Many people.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:14.510
INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember--

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:15.290
MARTHA: Yes, there were--

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:16.430
INTERVIEWER 1: What do--
what do you remember?

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:19.210
MARTHA: There were one
building where the-- the--

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:23.750
when you passed by, they were
yelling, yelling, crying.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:26.450
It was terrible to pass by.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:30.220
And in my transport, it
was a 17-year-old girl

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.390
what got crazy.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.910
Her mother was a Christian.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.770
She was left behind.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:40.040
And her father was already dead.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.160
And she-- she was Jewish.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:47.570
And she was-- she
got crazy there.

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:48.945
She was in my
transport because--

00:14:48.945 --> 00:14:50.153
INTERVIEWER 1: What happened?

00:14:50.153 --> 00:14:51.890
MARTHA: --she were mixed.

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.810
I never saw her again.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:57.730
Maybe was in this house
where all these crazy people

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.530
were yelling.

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.350
INTERVIEWER 2: What happened
then in Theresienstadt?

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:08.140
What happened as the war
was coming to an end?

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.180
MARTHA: Some-- it were some--

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.200
some, uh, things.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:20.600
I saw once, the Gestapo put
the fist through a man's mouth

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.760
because he said something.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.590
And his teeth flow out.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:31.190
One men was with a
little knife picked.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:34.190
He was full of scars here.

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:36.540
So some things like this.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:41.950
But they-- that were Jews
what were left from the other

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:44.660
transport, not from--

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.590
from our.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:51.490
But there were also Jews from
but has Christian woman--

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:52.550
women.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:58.480
And many were divorced, too,
when they were in the camp.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.007
The woman divorced them.

00:16:00.007 --> 00:16:01.340
INTERVIEWER 1: Divorced the men.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:01.840
MARTHA: Yes.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.412
And the men was--
were shipped away.

00:16:04.412 --> 00:16:05.662
INTERVIEWER 1: To [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:05.662 --> 00:16:07.130
MARTHA: To Auschwitz, yes.

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:09.140
The same like the women--

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:10.635
the same thing.

00:16:10.635 --> 00:16:14.690
INTERVIEWER 1: You mentioned
before that you could only

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:16.820
write 31 words.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:17.660
MARTHA: 30 words.

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.410
INTERVIEWER 1: 30.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.105
Are these-- is this a postcard--

00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:20.605
MARTHA: Yes.

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:22.230
INTERVIEWER 1: --with
a number on each?

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:23.968
MARTHA: Yes, that I wrote.

00:16:23.968 --> 00:16:26.010
INTERVIEWER 1: And you
put a number on each word.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:26.510
MARTHA: Yes.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:31.050
Because if it was one word more,
they break it and it never--

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:34.730
INTERVIEWER 1: So you cross
out the 31st word here.

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.070
You see this?

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:38.356
"Deine"-- you cross it out.

00:16:38.356 --> 00:16:38.856
MARTHA: Yes.

00:16:38.856 --> 00:16:38.960
Yes.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.070
INTERVIEWER 1: So it
should be only 30 words.

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:40.570
MARTHA: Yes.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:46.040


00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.310
INTERVIEWER 1: The last sentence
is "bitte vergiss mich nicht"--

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:50.720
don't forget me.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.260
MARTHA: Yes.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.718
INTERVIEWER 1: And you couldn't
say, "deine"-- your mother.

00:16:53.718 --> 00:16:55.180
You have to say just "Mutti."

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:55.680
MARTHA: Yes.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:00.210


00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:06.060
INTERVIEWER 2: Uh,
what happened, uh,

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:10.118
later on, as the
Americans started to bomb

00:17:10.118 --> 00:17:12.540
and as the war was
coming to a close?

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.333
What happened to you?

00:17:15.333 --> 00:17:18.030
MARTHA: I-- I had the--

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:20.790
I met a man--

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:25.348
man what was in the
Sudeten, our neighbor.

00:17:25.348 --> 00:17:29.280
And he had a Christian wife.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:36.990
And uh, when the quarantine
was over Theresienstadt because

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.930
of these infected
people from Auschwitz,

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:43.500
he said to me, if
I have the courage,

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:49.897
to go at night with him
over the wall and walk home.

00:17:49.897 --> 00:17:53.790
It-- and I said,
I would like to.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:59.190
Because some people left, and
were taken by the troopers

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:01.860
back in the camp.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:06.300
And I was afraid
because of the typhus

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.930
that we had the long quarantine.

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.270
And so-- and he, too.

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:14.820
He had two sons in-- in--

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.590
in one camp.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:18.630
He didn't know where.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:24.950
And so we-- we went one
night when all was quiet.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:28.860
It was not quiet
because the shooting was

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.950
from Czech and Germans outside.

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:33.420
We could hear it.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:38.640
But, uh, he said to me, I
help you over my shoulders,

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.410
and you jump down.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:41.290
And I did.

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:43.030
And he came after me.

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.230
But we had to crawl
on hand and feet

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:50.430
because that they were
shooting the German

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:55.590
with-- the last German with
the Czech were shooting.

00:18:55.590 --> 00:19:00.240
And they-- on this side,
where they're shooting,

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.340
there were no troopers.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:06.360
So we-- we were not seen.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.860
It took about an hour to this--

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.260
to the next town.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.430
And these men had, from--

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:18.310
from a business fam--

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:21.930
family there that he
knew, and they let

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:25.150
us slept over and gave us food.

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:28.800
And the next day, we
walked away again.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:33.450
And uh, some trucks took us--

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:37.350
French trucks and
one Czech truck--

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.580
took us further home.

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:41.760
There were no trains.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.960
It was all bombed.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.627
INTERVIEWER 1: You
had crossed the lines

00:19:44.627 --> 00:19:46.920
into the Allied territory?

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.040
There were French
soldiers already?

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:49.770
MARTHA: No.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:53.658
The French were with-- with the
Czechs, not with the German--

00:19:53.658 --> 00:19:54.450
INTERVIEWER 1: Yes.

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:56.620
MARTHA: --at this time.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:00.050
They saved themselves
from the German.

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:02.132
So they took us.

00:20:02.132 --> 00:20:05.220
I-- we both-- we spo--

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.540
could speak French.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.390
So we communicated with them.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:12.510
And when they had
to go another way,

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:17.040
they let us out from the
truck, and we walked again

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:22.630
until we find another truck what
took us a little bit further.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:27.960
And then, when we
came nearer to--

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:32.460
to our hometowns, there
were already train.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.610
So we took the train.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:40.520
He-- he had another way,
and I had another way.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:44.760
So, we, after two days,
we were finally home.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:50.160
I find my husband very sick
and my children, thanks God,

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.690
I find them all.

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:57.510
But, uh, my-- my smaller
daughter didn't recognize me.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:58.820
INTERVIEWER 1: What did she do?

00:20:58.820 --> 00:20:59.362
MARTHA: What?

00:20:59.362 --> 00:21:01.800
INTERVIEWER 1: What did
she do when you came?

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.600
What did the child do--

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.480
do when you came?

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.460
MARTHA: The elder
one was very happy.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.418
INTERVIEWER 1: No, the
child-- the younger one.

00:21:10.418 --> 00:21:14.070
MARTHA: The-- the younger
didn't recognize me.

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:16.960
And my husband was very sick.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.230
We didn't-- he--

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:25.950
we were thinking he has typhus
because he has so high fever.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:29.010
But he got some antibiotics.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:33.600
And he was, then, OK.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:39.990
But he never
recovered, uh, for--

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:44.580
his mind never recovered
from this ordeal.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:49.590
He was not, when we were--

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:52.750
in 1947, when we--

00:21:52.750 --> 00:22:00.420
when we went to South
America, he was very unhappy.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:06.310
He never could
attach to a new life.

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:08.760
INTERVIEWER 2: When
you came back home,

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:13.270
your youngest child was
still with the other family?

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:13.770
MARTHA: No.

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:15.740
They give her to me back.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.880
She was till the end, yes.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:23.377
And the-- the older was
by, in the pastor's house.

00:22:23.377 --> 00:22:24.960
INTERVIEWER 2: So
when you came back--

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.640
MARTHA: They gave
her back to me, yes.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.400
INTERVIEWER 2: You went
to collect your children?

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.030
MARTHA: Yes.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:32.000
I-- we had--

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.910
our apartment had,
uh, a Czech physician.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:41.230
And when we came
back, he moved out.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:43.350
He gave us our--

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:44.640
apartment back.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.210
But it was-- most was robbed.

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:51.450
We had a few furniture inside.

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:57.720
But all the other
thing were taken away.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.510
INTERVIEWER 2: So when you
went to collect your younger

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:05.580
daughter at this family's,
what was your reaction when

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.830
you came there?

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:10.470
MARTHA: I was not in
good shape, either.

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:16.020
I was limping from
this humidity.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:20.270
I-- I had, uh, sciatica.

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:24.010
I was in very much
pain and was limping.

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:28.520
But they give me some electric--

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:33.080


00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.790
electric bus.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:36.650
And I couldn't stand it.

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:38.545
My nerves couldn't take this.

00:23:38.545 --> 00:23:39.420
INTERVIEWER 2: Hm-mm.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:39.920
Hm-mm.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:48.640
MARTHA: And there-- maybe
I've forget something to tell.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.880
INTERVIEWER 2: What happened to
that man who you escaped with?

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.130
MARTHA: Yeah, he
went from one camp

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:58.030
to the other looking
for his children.

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:00.940
And when he was told--

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:06.310
the children were about 10 and
12 years old and were Jewish.

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:11.990
The mother was Christian,
and the children were Jewish.

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:13.440
Because he was from a--

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.030


00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:20.550
not Orthodox but a
believing family--

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:24.970
and, uh, when he hear that
the children were killed,

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:27.350
so he shot himself.

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:30.790
They had the word-- the
German had the word--

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:36.070
killed when flying--
when they fled.

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:37.640
They were killed.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.400
But it was not true.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.898
They always said, um--

00:24:40.898 --> 00:24:45.200


00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.210
INTERVIEWER 1: Trying to escape.

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:47.790
MARTHA: Yes.

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:52.295
They always said,
uh, erschossen--

00:24:52.295 --> 00:24:55.400
auf der Flucht erschossen.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.500
You understand?

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.000
So it--

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.792
INTERVIEWER 1: Shot
while trying to escape.

00:24:59.792 --> 00:25:00.320
MARTHA: Yes.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.950
But he couldn't get over.

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:03.850
And, uh, he wrote me.

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:08.570
And his last letter,
what he wrote me, uh,

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:12.140
said I should not answer him.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.300
He will not be alive anymore.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:21.450
And then his wife sent me a
card, said he shot himself.

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:24.020
That was the end for--

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.930
for many from these people
what couldn't get over

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:32.910
not to find their
children anymore.

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:35.890
This-- this woman
what had typhus

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:40.060
what was sleeping
on top of me, she

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:43.990
was so happy to see her
three-year-old child

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:50.290
and husband, and she died in the
quarantine with infected typhus

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:53.350
from her sister because
she kissed her sister.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:58.090
There were so many
tragedies on the end,

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:00.990
where they could be free.

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:04.166
They had to die, anyway.

00:26:04.166 --> 00:26:07.130
INTERVIEWER 2: You
going to end there?

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.740
Um, do you want to--

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:10.320
that's it?

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.522
Do you want to end up now?

00:26:11.522 --> 00:26:12.175
INTERVIEWER 1: I think, yes.

00:26:12.175 --> 00:26:13.000
INTERVIEWER 2: OK.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.393
Thank you very, very much--

00:26:14.393 --> 00:26:15.351
MARTHA: You're welcome.

00:26:15.351 --> 00:26:16.351
INTERVIEWER 1: --Martha.

00:26:16.351 --> 00:26:24.690


00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:27.090
MARTHA: I have so many cards.

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:29.580
I take only some of them.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:42.190


00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:44.938
INTERVIEWER 1: Is
your husband alive?

00:26:44.938 --> 00:26:45.730
MARTHA: My husband?

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:46.230
No.

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:50.452
He died four years after
when we went Argentina.

00:26:50.452 --> 00:27:00.380
He-- he went every Sunday to
the port with us and said,

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:04.070
I have to see the ship
that brought me here.

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:08.080
He said-- said the--

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.040
das verfluchte Schiff.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.420
INTERVIEWER 1: The cursed ship.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.670
MARTHA: The cursed ship
that brought me over here.

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:15.900
He couldn't get over.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.510
He died four years
later on cancer.

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:21.050
INTERVIEWER 1: Of cancer.

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:25.880
MARTHA: So I am 33 years
widow with two children.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:32.430
And I had not much restitution
because I had not many papers.

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:40.850
I-- my parents, my husband,
paid a big insurance in Germany.

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:45.570
They had, in every
country, um, offices.

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:48.910
And they paid the insurance
in US dollars what--

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:52.940
what was very expensive
for Czech koruns.

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.500
And I got nothing
for it-- nothing.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:28:00.610
And they confirmed it, that
it's true, that I should get it.

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:02.130
But I got nothing--

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:02.810
nothing.

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:05.840
I-- I had the help
from my parents in--

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.000
in the Sudeten.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.790
It's now Czechoslovakia.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:14.770
Now, the-- the Czech has
the-- the help, but I--

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:16.260
but I have nothing.

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:21.030
And even the, um, government
here, gave from the gold

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:27.030
what our president
left here that he took.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:30.660
When he left Czechoslovakia,
President Benes

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.750
took gold with him.

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:37.410
And this was given to
Czech people that lost

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:40.250
their houses in Czechoslovakia.

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:46.670
But they had to be in
1948 and 1949 and citiz--

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:48.260
American citizens.

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:49.120
And I wasn't.

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:52.477
I was in-- in Argentina in '48.

00:28:52.477 --> 00:28:54.990


00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:57.030
I came there in '47.

00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:04.070
And I came to America
[? '63. ?] So my claim was not--

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:06.810
not, uh, allowed.

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:12.860
They-- they wanted to give me a
hearing, but the lawyer told me

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:16.760
I had not to spend a penny for
it because it wouldn't help.

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:21.430
It was only for the people that
were here, American citizens,

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:23.660
till '49.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.000
So I fell, always,
on the dry side,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.662
never on the buttered side.

00:29:28.662 --> 00:29:35.140
And it was very hard in
Argentina for my children

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:36.520
and for myself.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:40.720
And my husband, uh, was really--

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:46.360
my children had not a youth
because even my younger

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.250
daughter was eight a
half years old when

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:53.530
we came to Argen-- five years
old when we came to Argentina.

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:58.310
She was eight a half years
old when my husband died.

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:02.130
And the older one was 15 a half.

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:03.970
So they had not youth.

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:07.240
They both had to
work from 14 years.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.620
And, uh, I--

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:14.500
I worked 16 hours a day
because I had to make a living.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:19.090
INTERVIEWER 1: While in
Argentina, did you meet

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:22.692
or get-- come in contact with
Germans, with Nazis there?

00:30:22.692 --> 00:30:23.440
MARTHA: No.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:28.090
I had, um, a cousin,
rabbi, in-- in-- in London.

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:32.900
And he got to me through the
international committee--

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:38.010
intergovernmen--
intergovernmental committee

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:39.915
the free trip and this ship--

00:30:39.915 --> 00:30:41.290
INTERVIEWER 1: I
understand that.

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:44.240
But I was asking, while you
were living in Argentina,

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:48.220
and while you were living in
Argentina for so many years,

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:51.850
whether you spotted, whether
you knew that there were also

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:53.110
Nazis in Argentina?

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:55.080
MARTHA: Yes, yes-- many, many.

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.920
INTERVIEWER 1: Did
you meet any of them?

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.230
Did you--

00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.850
MARTHA: No.

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:02.830
They were Argentina Nazis, no?

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:05.830
In front of where I
lived was a dentist.

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:08.980
His son was a very big Nazi.

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:12.940
But the-- the German
Nazi, I never met there.

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:18.040
But around-- around the
town in the boroughs,

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.330
there were German.

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:27.720
And, uh, one case was
there were small synagogues

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.690
with, uh, little gardens.

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:33.070
And a child from--
from a rabbi was--

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:36.160
was bicycle around the--

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.560
the synagogue, and
a German shoot him.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.240
From this, I knew,
and I knew from--

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:47.250
from the-- the--

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:50.510
this, uh, DAIA, it--

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:54.040
it was a Jewish
organization, so they had a--

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:58.390
a home for children
what has no parents--

00:31:58.390 --> 00:31:59.920
Jewish children.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:05.370
And they, these Nazis, a
couple of them at night,

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.930
break in and cut this--

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:12.220
the children in their faces
with the razor blades.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:13.000
It's true.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.290
It's not a story.

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:15.183
It's really true.

00:32:15.183 --> 00:32:16.600
INTERVIEWER 1: And
that happened--

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.250
MARTHA: And that
happens in Argentina.

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:22.000
Always in-- that in
Argentina, come nothing out

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.400
in the big letters
in the newspapers.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.870
So in France only,
in the Jewish paper.

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:33.190
But uh, all over,
uh, anti-Semites--

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:35.980
all over, wherever you go.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:39.170
We should go to Chile, but
we didn't get the money.

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:41.480
So we-- we had to
stay in Argentina.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.720
My husband didn't want this.

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:50.430
He said, because on-- on
the custom, when we came in,

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:54.250
they already said,
these are all Jews.
