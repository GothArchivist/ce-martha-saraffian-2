          "text": "Martha Saraffian (neé Kummermann) was born in 1907 in a suburb of Prague and grew up in the German-speaking borderlands of Bohemia/Czechoslovakia, where she lived until shortly after the annexation by Nazi Germany in October 1938. Her observant Jewish family belonged to the upper-middle class – her father Friedrich Kummermann was a successful textile merchant. Martha was well educated, and an entrepreneur herself. In 1931 she married Hrand Saraffian, an Armenian Christian refugee from Constantinople, with whom she had two daughters, Noemi and Hanna. Despite her civil marriage to a Protestant, Martha Saraffian remained a member of the Jewish community and their first daughter, Noemi, was raised as Jewish. After the annexation the Saraffian family was discriminated against, persecuted for their \"mixed marriage.\"[1] Martha Saraffian was eventually deported to the Ghetto Theresienstadt/Terezín in 1945 and her husband interned in several forced labor camps. While many of Martha's family members perished in the Holocaust, including her mother who was murdered near Lublin, the couple and their children survived in occupied Czechia. After liberation, they emigrated to Argentina and later, in the 1960s, after Hrand had passed away, to New York City, where Martha lived until December 2006."
